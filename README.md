#Jasmine with Chutzpah

Durandal and Require Js Unit Testing using Jasmine Testing Framwork in Visual Studio 2012 with Chutzpah. 

In Durandal SPA project you migth wanted to write the Unit testing code for the JavaScript and Viewmodels. This project will help you to do it.

In General JavaScript Unit testing results can be viewed as a web page results. We have done this bit slightly different way, we can view unit testing results instantly with the help of Chutzpah. Also we can attach the Unit testing results to the Build events (If any Unit test fails which will be notified instantly in VS Error list explorer).

Chutzpah will give you the same C# kind of Test Explorer Ui for Javascript in Visual Studio, you can attach build events to the Javascript Unit Testing (In case any test case fails, this will throw you the Build Error). Chutzpah will take care of these kind of automated stuffs.

Please read the documentaions and tutorials...
